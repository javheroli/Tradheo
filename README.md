# Tradheo

What is Tradheo?
----------------

Tradheo is a software product/platform developed by Javier Herraiz Olivas as his dissertation to conclude it's course on Software Engineering at University of Seville. It was created with the main purpose to introduce people without any kind of knowledge in stock market so they can invest and have benefits. How? Consulting and computerizing the knowledge of a more than 30 years experienced proffesional in stock market to let our product make decisions according to business statistics. 

Basically, we offer a stock market trading decider and a simulator to check our performance versus your own decisions made. Also we include all the information and graphics about IBEX and DAX markets with a small delay.

Temporary planning
------------------
The planning for this project has been carried out by Javier Herraiz Olivas too, having both roles as only developer and manager. As a one member team, this project has been made using a custom agile method development by creating a Kanban board with every task related to this project. Each task has custom tags to recognise the job type associated with it (Ex: Marketing, Documentation, Testing, Back-end, Front-end, Investigation, Deployment), an unique identifying number to stablish a relation between commits and information to control the work effort such as the estimate work hours required to complete the task, the spent hours already done and the remaining hours.

You can visit the Kanban board in the following link:
